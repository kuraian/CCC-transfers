Mechanical engineers are recruited in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, power generation, environmental, electronics, bioengineering, agriculture, food processing, and consulting firms, among many others. Because of the variety of fields that are relevant to this profession, the undergraduate program covers a broad range of subjects, including dynamics, materials, thermal/fluids, vibrations, controls, computer- aided engineering, design and manufacturing. The innovative curriculum at UC Merced provides a rich educational experience that exposes students to engineering fundamentals, laboratory skills and advanced computational tools to solve realistic engineering problems."]]}

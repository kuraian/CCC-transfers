The bioengineering undergraduate degree also provides a solid foundation for medical and graduate schools and for careers in allied fields of government and policy. Bioengineering has led to the development of biocompatible implants, functional prostheses, sensitive diagnostics, precision medicines, sustainable agriculture, scalable biomanufacturing, and tools that have accelerated the pace of research and development in biomedicine.

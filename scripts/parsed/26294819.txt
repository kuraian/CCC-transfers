To ensure an intellectually coherent experience, students in the major are able to choose courses from areas including: (a) Cognitive Neuroscience; (b) Experimental Psychology\u2013Sensation, Perception, Attention, and Memory; (c) Language Science; and (d) Computational Cognitive Science. In addition, students are required to acquire a background in (a) calculus, (b) statistics, (c) introductory computer programming, and (d) some combination of the natural sciences, logic and philosophy of science, linguistics, or more advanced computer science or mathematics. This major prepares students for a research career in cognitive science, focusing on any of the current dominant approaches of the field. The study of cognition can be approached through cognitive neuroscience, behavioral experiments, language science, computational and mathematical modeling, or any combination of those. The major combines strong technical skills"]]}

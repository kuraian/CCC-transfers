The curriculum provides students with a quantitative understanding of the physical, chemical and biological principles that control the quality of our natural and engineered environment and focuses on the design, development, implementation and assessment of sustainable engineering solutions to society\u2019s waste and resource management challenges. In the coming decades, civil engineers will increasingly be called upon to address broader issues of environmental sustainability by minimizing the release of residuals through altered production processes and choice of materials; by capturing the resource value of wastes through recovery, recycling and reuse; and by managing natural resources to meet competing societal objectives."]]}

The program seeks to educate students to understand and then apply the theories and concepts of a broad, integrated curriculum covering computing, informatics, business fundamentals, and analytical decision-making. The major prepares students for a wide variety of careers and life experiences. Business Information Management majors can pursue careers in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors or can proceed to graduate school in several disciplines, including information systems, computing, economics, business, and law.

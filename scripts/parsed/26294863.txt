The major focuses on determinants of human health, well-being, and functioning in a broad range of developmental, social, cultural, and environmental contexts. Undergraduate students begin with basic course work in developmental psychology, health and preclinical (abnormal) psychology, and social psychology. Subsequent courses cover such topics as social, emotional, and cognitive development in children, adolescents, adults; behavioral disorders and developmental psychopathology; counseling and therapy; cultural, social, and personality influences on behavior; attitude formation and change; health psychology; stress and coping; and psychology and the law. Opportunities are available to work with faculty members on research in these and other areas. Undergraduate research experience provides a valuable background for entry into many graduate programs. Field study opportunities exist in hospitals, community health clinics, counseling centers, legal settings, environmental programs, social service agencies, schools and after-school programs, child care settings, and a wide variety of other community programs that offer a broad range of services.

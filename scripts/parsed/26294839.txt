In addition, prerequisites include one lower-division microeconomics course, and one course or one sequence selected from the statistics courses outlined below.

In establishing the undergraduate minor, the faculty anticipated three types of students to be drawn to courses in administration: 1) Students who wish to learn about the management of organizations as a way of preparing for a career in business, 2) Students preparing for careers in other fields that require some knowledge of management, and 3) Students who expect to go on to graduate work in management who wish early guidance and undergraduate work appropriate to this career"]]}

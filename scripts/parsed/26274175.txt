This can be done either by taking the elementary language courses or by passing a proficiency exam. Because the program is both specialized and broad, using a many-sided approach to the subject, it is recommended that students have a strong preparation in a related discipline, so that the group major in Dutch Studies may constitute the focal point to a larger area of interest. Suggested related fields of concentration are Comparative Literature, German, Spanish and Portuguese, History, History of Art, African-American Studies, Linguistics, South and Southeast Asian Studies. We encourage Dutch Studies students to do part of their study in the Netherlands or Flanders and to make use of the existing exchange"]]}

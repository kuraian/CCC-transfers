UC Merced emphasizes a highly interdisciplinary approach to environmental engineering, combining a strong theoretical foundation with field studies, laboratory experiments and computational simulations. Core courses within the major provide students with a firm foundation in the physical and life sciences and the ways that they apply to energy, hydrology, and air- and water-quality issues.
